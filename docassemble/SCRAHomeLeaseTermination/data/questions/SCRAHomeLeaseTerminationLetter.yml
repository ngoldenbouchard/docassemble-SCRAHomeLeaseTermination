subquestion: |
  Use this interview to help you write a letter to your landlord, telling them you want to end your housing lease early under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).

  - You get Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or deployment orders for more than 90 days, and
  - You provide at least a 30-day written notice along with your orders.
  
  If you follow these steps, your lease should end 30 days after your next rent payment is due.
